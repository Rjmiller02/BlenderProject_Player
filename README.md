## My first Blender Project with Rigging and Animation

This is one of my first blender projects for Dr. Sullin's 3D Graphics and Animation in Gaming course. It includes materials that were constructed in Blender and images that were created 
in GIMP and attached in Blender. There is also an armature that has been posed to create repeatable animations. Frames 1 - 84 give a standing to walking to back to standing animation,
frames 18 - 73 give a continuous walking animation, and frames 87 - 158 show a standing to crouching to back to standing animation.
